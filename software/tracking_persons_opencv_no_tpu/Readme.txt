This GIT commit of the persons tracker using OpenCV (no CNN / TPU inference needed here !) is based on the following GIT :
https://github.com/Practical-CV/Simple-object-tracking-with-OpenCV

Basically the idea is to extend this code with measuring the size eg width of the detected person boudning box, in order to know if the detected person is approaching Reachy Camera.
